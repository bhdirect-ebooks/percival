Hymns are easily recognized by their exuberant praise of the Lord, and they typically praise the Lord for who He is as the Creator (e.g., <a data-cross-ref='{\"scripture\":\"Ps.104.1-Ps.104.35\",\"valid\":true,\"confidence\":10}'>Ps. 104</a>) and Redeemer (e.g., <a data-cross-ref='{\"scripture\":\"Ps.105.1-Ps.105.45\",\"valid\":true,\"confidence\":10}'>Ps. 105</a>). Hymns usually have three sections: a call to praise God, the praise proper, and a concluding affirmation of faith or renewed call to praise. <a data-cross-ref='{\"scripture\":\"Ps.103.1-Ps.103.22\",\"valid\":true,\"confidence\":10}'>Psalm 103</a> is a good example of this structure: Call to Praise (vv. 1, 2), Praise (vv. 3–19), and Call to Praise (vv. 20–22).

The strophes (Introduction to Hebrew Poetry) are arranged concentrically: opening praise of the Lord as refuge (18:1–3), what the Lord does for the king (18:4–19), central praise of the Lord as refuge (18:20–30), what the Lord does through the king (18:31–45), and concluding praise of the Lord as refuge (18:46–50). The opening and closing strophes and the central strophe show the main point of the psalm: the praise of the Lord as refuge.
