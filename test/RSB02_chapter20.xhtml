      <h1>The Book of the Psalms</h1>
      <h2>Title</h2>
      <p class="noind">The title “Psalms” comes from the Greek and Latin tradition. The Septuagint (the Greek translation of the Old Testament) uses the word <span class="italic">Psalmos,</span> and the Latin Vulgate translation, which was the Bible the church used during the Middle Ages, uses the word <span class="italic">Psalmus</span>. Both of these terms mean “a song sung to the accompaniment of stringed instruments.” The New Testament uses <span class="italic">psalmos</span> as well (<a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Luke.20.42"}'>Luke 20:42</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Luke.24.44"}'>24:44</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Acts.1.20"}'>Acts 1:20</a>). The corresponding Hb. word <span class="italic">mizmor</span> occurs frequently in the title of various psalms (e.g., <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.3.1-Ps.3.8"}'>Ps. 3</a>). The Hebrew title, however, is “Praises,” a translation of the Hb. word <span class="italic">tehillah</span> (“praise”), and this title captures the overarching movement in the book from lamentation and suffering at the beginning to praise and glory at the end.</p>

      <h2>Author</h2>
      <p class="noind">Many of the psalms begin with a title linking the psalm with a particular individual or group, using a Hb. preposition that could possibly indicate dedication (“to David”), subject matter (“about David”), or authorship (“by David”). However, one of the few psalm titles with expanded content (<a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.18.1-Ps.18.50"}'>Ps. 18</a>) leaves little doubt that the title intends to identify the composer of the psalm. David is by far the most frequently cited author, most of his psalms being in the first two books (see Structure), though there is a small collection of psalms by him at the very end (<a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.138.1-Ps.145.21"}'>Pss. 138–145</a>). The tradition that associates David with singing and psalm composition is so strong (<a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"1Sam.16.14-1Sam.16.23"}'>1 Sam. 16:14–23</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"2Sam.1.17-2Sam.1.27"}'>2 Sam. 1:17–27</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"2Sam.22.1-2Sam.23.1"}'>2 Sam. 22; 2 Sam. 23:1</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"1Chr.6.31"}'>1 Chr. 6:31</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"1Chr.15.16"}'>15:16</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"1Chr.16.7"}'>16:7</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.18.1-Ps.18.50"}'>Ps. 18</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Amos.6.5"}'>Amos 6:5</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Matt.22.43"}'>Matt. 22:43</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Acts.1.16"}'>Acts 1:16</a>) that there is little doubt that David wrote many or all of the psalms that bear his name.</p>
      <p>Other authors appear in psalm titles: Moses (<a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.90.1-Ps.90.17"}'>Ps. 90</a>), Solomon (<a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.72.1-Ps.72.20"}'>Pss. 72</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.127.1-Ps.127.5"}'>127</a>), the sons of Korah (<a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.42.1-Ps.49.20"}'>Pss. 42–49</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.84.1-Ps.85.13"}'>84; 85</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.87.1-Ps.88.18"}'>87; 88</a>), Asaph (<a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.50.1-Ps.50.23"}'>Pss. 50</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.73.1-Ps.83.18"}'><a data-cross-ref='{"error":"start_verse_not_exist_18"}'>73</a>–<a data-cross-ref='{"error":"start_verse_not_exist_18"}'>83</a></a>), and Ethan the Ezrahite (<a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.89.1-Ps.89.52"}'>Ps. 89</a>). A number of psalms have no designated author (e.g., <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.1.1-Ps.1.6"}'>Pss. 1</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.71.1-Ps.71.24"}'>71</a>).</p>

      <h2>Date and Occasion</h2>
      <p class="noind">The titles of the psalms show that they were composed by individuals in response to particular corporate or individual experiences. The dates and occasions of the psalms (see the introductory paragraphs to the psalms in the notes) range from the time of Moses (<a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.90.1-Ps.90.17"}'>Ps. 90</a>), to the experiences of David (<a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.51.1-Ps.51.19"}'>Ps. 51</a>), to the time after the Babylonian exile (<a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.126.1-Ps.126.6"}'>Ps. 126</a>), a span of approximately one thousand <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page827" title="827" />years. Still, the psalms that originated in specific situations and were collected for use in private devotion or public worship were never so time-bound that they could not be used in a variety of new situations. Forming the collection as a whole took several centuries, and was not completed until sometime after the exile in Babylon. The entire collection is also known as the Psalter.</p>

      <h2>Genre</h2>
      <p class="noind">The broadest genre consideration is that the book of Psalms is poetry, not prose. For additional discussion of the poetic character of Psalms, see the Introduction to Hebrew Poetry.</p>
      <p>Distinguishing characteristics allow the individual psalms to be assigned to literary categories for the purpose of study. These categories are not to be seen as mutually exclusive but as perspectives from which to gain insight into the various psalms. The following are the literary categories commonly used in the book of Psalms.</p>
      <p><span class="italic">1. Hymns.</span> Hymns were composed for times when all is well. Hymns are easily recognized by their exuberant praise of the Lord, and they typically praise the Lord for who He is as the Creator (e.g., <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.104.1-Ps.104.35"}'>Ps. 104</a>) and Redeemer (e.g., <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.105.1-Ps.105.45"}'>Ps. 105</a>). Hymns usually have three sections: a call to praise God, the praise proper, and a concluding affirmation of faith or renewed call to praise. <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.103.1-Ps.103.22"}'>Psalm 103</a> is a good example of this structure: Call to Praise (<a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.103.1"}'>vv. 1</a>, 2), Praise (<a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.103.3-Ps.103.19"}'>vv. 3–19</a>), and Call to Praise (<a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.103.20-Ps.103.22"}'>vv. 20–22</a>). For other examples of hymns, see <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.8.1-Ps.8.9"}'>Pss. 8</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.19.1-Ps.19.14"}'>19</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.29.1-Ps.29.11"}'>29</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.33.1-Ps.33.22"}'>33</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.65.1-Ps.65.13"}'>65</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.67.1-Ps.68.35"}'>67; 68</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.93.1-Ps.93.5"}'>93</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.96.1-Ps.96.13"}'>96</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.98.1-Ps.98.9"}'>98</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.100.1-Ps.100.5"}'>100</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.111.1-Ps.111.10"}'>111</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.113.1-Ps.114.8"}'>113; 114</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.117.1-Ps.117.2"}'>117</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.135.1-Ps.135.21"}'>135</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.145.1-Ps.150.6"}'>145; 146; 147; 148; 149; 150</a>.</p>
      <p><span class="italic">2. Laments.</span> Laments were composed for when all is not well, and thus express emotions experienced in times of great sorrow or loss. In a lament, the psalmist opens his heart honestly to God, a heart filled with sadness, loneliness, perplexity, grief, abandonment, fear, or anger. With few exceptions (<a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.44.1-Ps.44.26"}'>Pss. 44</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.88.1-Ps.88.18"}'>88</a>) the laments turn to the Lord with confidence at the end. Laments usually have two sections: the plea for help followed by confidence or praise. <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.6.1-Ps.6.10"}'>Psalm 6</a> is a fine example: Plea for Help (<a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.6.1-Ps.6.7"}'>vv. 1–7</a>) and Confidence in Being Delivered (<a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.6.8"}'>vv. 8</a>, 9). For other examples, see <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.3.1-Ps.3.8"}'>Pss. 3</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.5.1-Ps.5.12"}'>5</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.7.1-Ps.7.17"}'>7</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.13.1-Ps.13.6"}'>13</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.17.1-Ps.17.15"}'>17</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.22.1-Ps.22.31"}'>22</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.25.1-Ps.28.9"}'>25; 26; 27; 28</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.38.1-Ps.39.13"}'>38; 39</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.42.1-Ps.43.5"}'>42; 43</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.51.1-Ps.51.19"}'>51</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.54.1-Ps.57.11"}'>54; 55; 56; 57</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.59.1-Ps.59.17"}'>59</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.61.1-Ps.61.8"}'>61</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.63.1-Ps.64.10"}'>63; 64</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.69.1-Ps.71.24"}'>69; 70; 71</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.74.1-Ps.74.23"}'>74</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.79.1-Ps.80.19"}'>79; 80</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.83.1-Ps.83.18"}'>83</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.86.1-Ps.86.17"}'>86</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.89.1-Ps.89.52"}'>89</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.102.1-Ps.102.28"}'>102</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.109.1-Ps.109.31"}'>109</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.120.1-Ps.120.7"}'>120</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.130.1-Ps.130.8"}'>130</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.140.1-Ps.143.12"}'>140; 141; 142; 143</a>.</p>
      <p><span class="italic">3. Thanksgiving Psalms.</span> Psalms of thanksgiving are like hymns in that they focus on the praise of God. The difference is that the hymns focus on what God has done in the distant past, in creation or in redemptive history, while the psalms of thanksgiving focus on what God has done in the recent, personal history of the psalmist. In particular, psalms of thanksgiving were written to celebrate those times when the Lord answered a prayer of lament. Like the hymns, the thanksgiving psalms usually have three sections: an opening intention to give thanks, a recollection of trouble (often mirroring the structure and language of the lament), and a concluding renewal of thanksgiving. <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.116.1-Ps.116.19"}'>Psalm 116</a> is probably the most personal example: Thanksgiving and Love (<a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.116.1-Ps.116.3"}'>vv. 1–3</a>), Recollection of Trouble (<a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.116.3-Ps.116.11"}'>vv. 3–11</a>), and Thanksgiving and Praise (<a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.116.12-Ps.116.19"}'>vv. 12–19</a>). For other examples, see <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.18.1-Ps.18.50"}'>Pss. 18</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.30.1-Ps.30.12"}'>30</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.34.1-Ps.34.22"}'>34</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.40.1-Ps.41.13"}'>40; 41</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.66.1-Ps.66.20"}'>66</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.92.1-Ps.92.15"}'>92</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.118.1-Ps.118.29"}'>118</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.124.1-Ps.124.8"}'>124</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.138.1-Ps.138.8"}'>138</a>.</p>
      <p><span class="italic">4. Psalms of Confidence (or Trust).</span> In between the laments and the psalms of thanksgiving are the psalms of confidence. There is typically some sort of trouble in view in these psalms, but the anguish is not as intense as in the laments, and the psalmist is not yet completely out of trouble. The dominant mood of these psalms is confidence that the Lord will deliver the psalmist. Unlike the first three genres, the psalms of confidence apparently have no common structure. For examples, see <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.16.1-Ps.16.11"}'>Pss. 16</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.23.1-Ps.23.6"}'>23</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.27.1-Ps.27.14"}'>27</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.62.1-Ps.62.12"}'>62</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.73.1-Ps.73.28"}'>73</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.91.1-Ps.91.16"}'>91</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.115.1-Ps.115.18"}'>115</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.121.1-Ps.121.8"}'>121</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.125.1-Ps.125.5"}'>125</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.131.1-Ps.131.3"}'>131</a>.</p>
      <p><span class="italic">5. Kingship Psalms.</span> Since God, the King of the universe, is the subject of many psalms and since David, the human king, is the subject of many other psalms, kingship is an important concept in the Psalter (see Characteristics and Primary Themes). A few psalms, however, focus so intensely on divine kingship (<a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.47.1-Ps.47.9"}'>Ps. 47</a>) or on human kingship (<a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.45.1-Ps.45.17"}'>Ps. 45</a>) that they stand out as a separate genre. Lacking any formal structure, the kingship psalms are held together by themes such as creation, redemption, judgment, supremacy over idols, and universal care. For examples of divine kingship psalms, see <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.24.1-Ps.24.10"}'>Pss. 24</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.29.1-Ps.29.11"}'>29</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.47.1-Ps.48.14"}'>47; 48</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.93.1-Ps.93.5"}'>93</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.95.1-Ps.99.9"}'>95; 96; 97; 98; 99</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.145.1-Ps.145.21"}'>145</a>; and for examples of human kingship psalms, see <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.2.1-Ps.2.12"}'>Pss. 2</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.20.1-Ps.21.13"}'>20; 21</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.45.1-Ps.45.17"}'>45</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.61.1-Ps.61.8"}'>61</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.63.1-Ps.63.11"}'>63</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.72.1-Ps.72.20"}'>72</a>.</p>
      <p><span class="italic">6. Wisdom Psalms.</span> Some psalms are at home in the world of Proverbs, Job, and Ecclesiastes. There is <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page828" title="828" />a certain diction that these psalms share with the other wisdom books: pronouncements of blessing, numerical sayings, “better than” sayings, alphabetic structuring, and admonitions. The wisdom psalms also make use of themes found in the Wisdom Literature: the way of the righteous and the way of the wicked, the contrast between the wise and the foolish, practical advice, retribution, and the fear of the Lord. The convergence of wisdom’s diction and wisdom’s themes suffices to place certain psalms in this category. For examples, see <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.1.1-Ps.1.6"}'>Pss. 1</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.19.1-Ps.19.14"}'>19</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.32.1-Ps.32.11"}'>32</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.34.1-Ps.34.22"}'>34</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.37.1-Ps.37.40"}'>37</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.49.1-Ps.49.20"}'>49</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.73.1-Ps.73.28"}'>73</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.112.1-Ps.112.10"}'>112</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.119.1-Ps.119.176"}'>119</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.128.1-Ps.128.6"}'>128</a>.</p>

      <h2>Literary Features</h2>
      <p class="noind">The psalms are arranged in five books. The end of each book is marked by doxology (<a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.1.1-Ps.150.6"}'><a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.1.1-Ps.150.6"}'>Pss. <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.150.1-Ps.150.6"}'>1–41</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"error":"start_verse_not_exist_6"}'>42</a>–<a data-cross-ref='{"error":"start_verse_not_exist_6"}'>72</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"error":"start_verse_not_exist_6"}'>73</a>–<a data-cross-ref='{"error":"start_verse_not_exist_6"}'>89</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"error":"start_verse_not_exist_6"}'>90</a>–<a data-cross-ref='{"error":"start_verse_not_exist_6"}'>106</a>; 107–150</a></a>). Jewish tradition holds that the number five was chosen to match the five books of Moses, and this is certainly the case. Both the five books of Moses and the five books of the Psalms are <span class="italic">torah</span> (instruction) from the Lord (<a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.1.2"}'>Ps. 1:2</a>).</p>
      <p>Book 1 begins with the inauguration of the Davidic covenant (<a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.2.1-Ps.2.12"}'>Ps. 2</a>) and ends with the promises of <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.2.1-Ps.2.12"}'>Ps. 2</a> coming to realization (<a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.41.1-Ps.41.13"}'>Ps. 41</a>). Book 2 ends with the covenant of kingship being transferred to Solomon (<a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.72.1-Ps.72.20"}'>Ps. 72</a>), who is a type of the blessed man of <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.1.1-Ps.1.6"}'>Ps. 1</a> (see the imagery in <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.72.5-Ps.72.7"}'>Ps. 72:5–7</a>) and a type of the Messianic King of <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.2.1-Ps.2.12"}'>Ps. 2</a> (see the language in <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.72.8-Ps.72.11"}'>Ps. 72:8–11</a>). Book 3 then ends on an ominous note. The first psalm of the section complains that the righteous suffer. The last psalm of the section laments that the Davidic covenant seems to have failed, with the king’s crown rolling in the dust (<a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.89.1-Ps.89.52"}'>Ps. 89</a>). <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.88.1-Ps.88.18"}'>Ps. 88</a> is the only psalm without praise. The remaining books answer the question burning in the hearts and minds of the postexilic community: “How do we live in the absence of the Davidic king?” Book 4 replies that we live by faith that the Lord is still King in spite of evidence to the contrary. Within this book, <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.93.1-Ps.99.9"}'>Pss. 93–99</a>, called “enthronement psalms,” look to God’s reign on earth. Book 5 replies that we live with an obedience (<a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.119.1-Ps.119.176"}'>Ps. 119</a>) that focuses on the true worship of God (<a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.145.1-Ps.150.6"}'>Ps. 145–150</a>). It begins by thanking God for bringing Israel back from the exile, and includes psalms holding up David as a model for piety (<a data-cross-ref='{"error":"start_verse_not_exist_6"}'>138</a>–<a data-cross-ref='{"error":"start_verse_not_exist_6"}'>145</a>), as well as psalms predicting the reign of the Messiah (110).</p>

      <h2>Characteristics and Primary Themes</h2>
      <p class="noind"><a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.1.1-Ps.2.12"}'>Psalms 1 and 2</a> introduce us to the main themes of the book of Psalms: the life of holiness and happiness (<a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.1.1-Ps.1.6"}'>Ps. 1</a>) under the reign of the divine King and His Messiah (<a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.2.1-Ps.2.12"}'>Ps. 2</a>).</p>
      <p><a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.1.1-Ps.1.6"}'>Psalm 1</a> gives us the purpose of the book of Psalms: to provide a manual for meditating on the instruction of the Lord, so that we can experience the “blessed” life, a life of abundant holiness and happiness. <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.2.1-Ps.2.12"}'>Psalm 2</a> gives us the overarching message of the book of Psalms: the Divine King reigns through His Messiah, who comes from the line of David. In fact, concerns related to the Davidic king are so prevalent in the Psalter that the book of Psalms in many ways functions as the hymnbook of the king. In the ancient Near East, the king was a key figure in worship, leading the people in the praise and worship of their deities. The king of Israel, of course, stands out among the other kings in the region as a worshiper of the only true God, the representative of God’s people before the divine throne. Thus, the book of Psalms has special importance for the sons of David and, preeminently, David’s greatest son—the Messiah. It is no accident, therefore, that the New Testament authors extensively quote from the book of Psalms, even indicating that they belong on the lips of Jesus in a special way (e.g., <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Heb.2.10-Heb.2.13"}'>Heb. 2:10–13</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Heb.10.5-Heb.10.7"}'>10:5–7</a>).</p>
      <p>Since the Davidic king had a key role in worship, we also see that the book of Psalms is designed specifically for liturgical use. Many of them, in fact, call on the people of God to worship the Lord (e.g., <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.95.6"}'>Pss. 95:6</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.132.7"}'>132:7</a>). Consequently, the psalms have been treasured by God’s people for use in His worship down through the centuries.</p>

      <h2>Theology of the Psalms</h2>
      <p class="noind">Just as the Psalter was formed during the entire period of the Old Testament, so the theology of the psalms is as large as the Old Testament. Martin Luther called the Psalms “a little Bible, and the summary of the Old Testament.” The overarching presentation of God in the book of Psalms is God as King. Two corollaries to God as King in the Psalms are God as Creator and God as Redeemer. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page829" title="829" />God’s transcendence and his immanence, along with virtually all of his other attributes, run like golden threads through the entire Psalter.</p>
      <p>Therefore, the book of Psalms gives us one of the most complete and comprehensive revelations of the character of God in the entire Bible. If we want to know who God is, what He has done, and how we should respond to Him, the book of Psalms is one of the best places to start.</p>

      <h2>Psalms in the Larger Story of the Bible</h2>
      <p class="noind">The book of Psalms was in all likelihood completed during the postexilic era and was compiled among other reasons to answer the question: “How do we live in the absence of the Davidic King?” (see Literary Features). As such, the book of Psalms served to give hope to God’s people that the Messiah would one day come, a hope that is realized finally in Christ and the consummation of His reign, as revealed in the New Testament. As we await the return of Christ, believers today are somewhat like believers who are seeking to understand how we are to live in the physical absence of the Davidic king, though we know that even now, Christ rules as the King of kings by His Spirit in the church and over all creation as the Creator and Lord of all. Like the Jews before the incarnation, we await the coming of the Messiah, only this time we are looking for His second coming, and the book of Psalms still serves to encourage that hope.</p>

      <h2>Christ in the Psalms</h2>
      <p class="noind">Christian readers of the Psalms appreciate the relationship these ancient songs have to Jesus Christ. Jesus told His disciples after the resurrection that “everything written about me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled” (<a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Luke.24.44"}'>Luke 24:44</a>). The Old Testament, including the Psalms, looked forward to Christ’s coming, His suffering, and His glorification. Jesus and the New Testament writers use the Psalms to express His suffering (<a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Matt.27.46"}'>Matt. 27:46</a>) and His glorification (<a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Matt.22.41-Matt.22.46"}'>Matt. 22:41–46</a>), in keeping with the overarching movement of the Psalter (see Title). Often, individual psalms begin with the reflection of David on his life or on events in his life and them move to David’s greatest son, the Messiah to come, such as <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.2.1-Ps.2.12"}'>Pss. 2</a> and <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.110.1-Ps.110.7"}'>110</a>. <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.23.1-Ps.23.6"}'>Psalm 23</a> points the reader directly to Christ, the Good Shepherd who gave His life for His sheep (cf. <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"John.10.11-John.10.18"}'>John 10:11–18</a>).</p>
      <p>In addition, since Jesus is Lord of the covenant, the Psalms are sung to Him, and since Jesus is Servant of the covenant, the psalms are sung by Him. Jesus is therefore above us as the One to whom we sing, and Jesus is beside us as the One who sings with us in all of life’s experiences (<a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Heb.2.12"}'>Heb. 2:12</a>).</p>

      <h2>History of Interpretation</h2>
      <p class="noind">Traditionally, a psalm was interpreted in its presumed historical context from the books of Samuel and Kings. One problem with this approach is that only fourteen psalms contain historical information in the title. A second problem is that some of the historical information in the titles is problematic (see Special Issues). So this approach is only partially helpful. At the end of the nineteenth century, there was a move to study a given psalm in the context of other psalms from the same genre. This approach remains an integral part of interpreting the book of Psalms to this day. In the mid-1980s, the book of Psalms began to be studied not as a random collection of poems but as a purposely arranged collection. This means that a given psalm is to be interpreted in the context of the surrounding psalms as well as in the context of its genre.</p>

      <h2>Special Issues</h2>
      <p class="noind"><span class="italic">The Curses of the Psalms.</span> Some psalms, called imprecatory psalms, cry out not only for the righteous to be vindicated, but also for God to punish the wicked (e.g., <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.69.22-Ps.69.28"}'>Ps. 69:22–28</a>). Such prayers reflect the calling of Israel to holy war as God’s instruments of judgment. With the coming of Christ to bear God’s judgment, the warfare of God’s people continues, now primarily directed against “spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places” (<a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Eph.6.12"}'>Eph. 6:12</a>). In their warfare, Christians are commanded to bless their personal enemies, overcoming evil with good (<a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Rom.12.17-Rom.12.21"}'>Rom. 12:17–21</a>). Theologians are divided over whether there might be circumstances <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page830" title="830" />under which Christians may pray the imprecatory psalms against the church’s enemies in the new covenant era. If there is a place for such prayers, two things must be kept in mind: First, as under the old covenant, the imprecatory psalms are not for use against just any enemy who causes problems for God’s people; rather, they are for enemies who are flagrantly and impenitently evil in their actions against Christ’s church. Second, in praying imprecatory psalms, space must always be allowed for the Lord to answer them by redeeming our enemies through judgment, just as He has done for us. Christ bore the imprecations that were rightly directed at us as the enemies of God, and so we passed through judgment in Him unto eternal life. God may do the same for our enemies, uniting them to Christ so that He bears the imprecations in their place, granting them the gift of eternal life (cf. <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Gal.3.10-Gal.3.14"}'>Gal. 3:10–14</a>).</p>
      <p><span class="italic">Titles.</span> Scholars have long debated whether the titles of the various psalms were written by the authors of the psalms themselves or if they are later additions. The titles are either an original part of the psalms or they come from early tradition, and were added before the final canonical form of the book was completed before the Septuagint translation of 200 <span class="smcaps">b.c.</span> Although the debate continues, evidence such as the appearance of the same information in the title to <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.18.1-Ps.18.50"}'>Psalm 18</a> and in <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"2Sam.22.1"}'>2 Samuel 22:1</a> means that the titles should be taken as original to the psalms and thus contain critical information about their original setting. In other words, the life settings described in the psalm titles are accurate and reflect the historical circumstances under which they were written. The titles contain five types of information:</p>
      <p>1. Authorship. See the discussion at Author above.</p>
      <p>2. Historical Background. Fourteen psalms have historical information in the title (<a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.3.1-Ps.3.8"}'>Pss. 3</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.7.1-Ps.7.17"}'>7</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.18.1-Ps.18.50"}'>18</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.30.1-Ps.30.12"}'>30</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.34.1-Ps.34.22"}'>34</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.51.1-Ps.52.9"}'>51; 52</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.54.1-Ps.54.7"}'>54</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.56.1-Ps.57.11"}'>56; 57</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.59.1-Ps.60.12"}'>59; 60</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.63.1-Ps.63.11"}'>63</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.142.1-Ps.142.7"}'>142</a>). There are a some places where it is either hard to match the content of the title with the content of the psalm (e.g., <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.30.1-Ps.30.12"}'>Ps. 30</a>) or to match the content of the title and the psalm with the historical narrative (e.g., <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.3.1-Ps.3.8"}'>Ps. 3</a> and <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"2Sam.18.5"}'>2 Sam. 18:5</a>). While the historical titles may give us an indication of the origin of a psalm, they are of limited help in interpretation; see History of Interpretation above.</p>
      <p>3. Genre. A number of the terms in the titles classify the psalms into ancient genres. Some are frequent, e.g, <span class="italic">mizmor</span> (“psalm”) and <span class="italic">shir</span> (“song”), while others are rare. It is difficult, however, to know the precise meaning of the terms used, and some psalms are both a <span class="italic">mizmor</span> and a <span class="italic">shir</span> (<a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.30.1-Ps.30.12"}'>Pss. 30</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.66.1-Ps.68.35"}'>66; 67; 68</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.75.1-Ps.75.10"}'>75</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.83.1-Ps.83.18"}'>83</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.87.1-Ps.88.18"}'>87; 88</a>). In contemporary discussions, genre is discerned from the structure and content of the psalms and not from the titles.</p>
      <p>4. Musical Direction. Some musical notes refer to instruments, e.g., “flutes” (<a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.5.1-Ps.5.12"}'>Ps. 5</a>) and “stringed instruments” (<a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.6.1-Ps.6.10"}'>Ps. 6</a>). The meaning of other musical notes is obscure, which is why translators transcribe the Hebrew terms, e.g., “Sheminith” (<a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.6.1-Ps.6.10"}'>Ps. 6</a>) and “Shiggaion” (<a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.7.1-Ps.7.17"}'>Ps. 7</a>); the same holds true for the ubiquitous “<span class="italic">selah</span>” (<a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.3.2"}'>Ps. 3:2</a>).</p>
      <p>5. Instructions. Occasionally, the titles indicate how the psalms were used in formal worship. Of these, the best known are the “Songs of Ascents.”</p>

        <p epub:type="bridgehead">DIVINE REVELATION</p>
        <p class="noind">General revelation provides us with the knowledge that God exists. “The heavens declare the glory of God,” says the psalmist. God’s glory is displayed in the works of His hands. This display is so clear and manifest that no creature can possibly miss it. It unveils God’s eternal power and deity (<a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Rom.1.18-Rom.1.23"}'>Romans 1:18–23</a>). Revelation in nature does not give a full revelation of God. It does not give us the information about God the Redeemer that we find in the Bible. But the God who is revealed in nature is the same God who is revealed in Scripture.</p>
        <p>Not everyone in the world has read the Bible or heard the gospel proclaimed. But the light of nature shines upon everyone in every place, in every time. God’s general revelation takes place every day. He is never without a witness to Himself. The visible world is like a mirror that reflects the glory of its maker.</p>
        <p>The world is a stage for God. He is the chief actor who appears front and center. No curtain can fall and obscure His presence. We know from one glimpse of creation that nature is not its own mother. There is no such “mother” as Mother Nature. Nature itself is powerless to produce life of any kind. In itself, nature is barren. The power to produce life resides in the Author of nature—God. To substitute nature as the source of life is to confuse the creature with the Creator. All forms of nature worship are acts of idolatry that are detestable to God.</p>
        <p>Because of the force of general revelation, every human being knows that God exists. Atheism involves the utter denial of something that is known to be true. This is why the Bible says, “The fool has said in his heart, ‘There is no God’” (<a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.14.1"}'>Psalm 14:1</a>). When the Scripture so chastens the atheist by calling him a “fool,” it is making a moral judgment upon him. To be a fool in biblical terms is not to be dim-witted or lacking in intelligence; it is to be immoral. As the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom, so the denial of God is the height of foolishness.</p>
        <p>The agnostic, likewise, denies the force of general revelation. The agnostic is less strident than the atheist; he does not flatly deny the existence of God. Rather, the agnostic declares that there is insufficient evidence to decide one way or the other about God’s existence. He prefers to suspend his judgment, to leave the issue of God’s existence as an open question. However, in light of the clarity of general revelation, the stance of agnosticism is no less detestable to God than that of the militant atheist.</p>
        <p>But for anyone whose mind and heart are open, the glory of God is wonderful to see—from the billions of universes in the heavens to the subatomic particles that make up the tiniest of molecules. What an incredible God we serve.</p>

Of greater difficulty is the lack of any mention of the temple in the body of the psalm (Introduction: Characteristics and Themes) and that the psalm is a song of thanksgiving for healing.

The theme of the poem is how to live in the light of an inevitable death, especially in light of the prosperity of the rich. The psalm has three strophes (Introduction to Hebrew Poetry): a call to listen to the teaching (<a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.49.1-Ps.49.4"}'>vv. 1–4</a>), a warning that wealth cannot redeem (<a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.49.5-Ps.49.12"}'>vv. 5–12</a>), and a promise that God will redeem (<a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.49.13-Ps.49.20"}'>vv. 13–20</a>).

      <aside>
        <p epub:type="bridgehead">HUMAN DEPRAVITY</p>
        <p class="noind">A common point of debate among theologians focuses on the question, are human beings basically good or basically evil? The hinge upon which the argument turns is the word <span class="italic">basically.</span> It is a virtual universal consensus that nobody is perfect. We accept the maxim “To err is human.”</p>
        <p>The Bible says that “all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God” (<a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Rom.3.23"}'>Romans 3:23</a>). Despite this verdict on human shortcomings, the idea persists in our humanistically dominated culture that sin is something peripheral or tangential to our nature. Indeed, we are flawed by sin. Our moral records exhibit blemishes. But somehow we think that our evil deeds reside at the rim or edge of our character and never penetrate to the core. Basically, it is assumed, people are inherently good. But if we lift our gaze to the ultimate standard of goodness—the holy character of God—we realize that what appears to be a basic goodness on an earthly level is corrupt to the core.</p>
        <p>The Bible teaches the total depravity of the human race. Total depravity means radical corruption. We must be careful to note the difference between <span class="italic">total</span> depravity and <span class="italic">utter</span> depravity. To be utterly depraved is to be as wicked as one could possibly be. Hitler was extremely depraved, but he could have been worse than he was. I am a sinner. Yet I could sin more often and more severely than I actually do. I am not utterly depraved, but I am totally depraved. For total depravity means that I and everyone else are depraved or corrupt in the totality of our being. There is no part of us that is left untouched by sin. Our minds, our wills, and our bodies are affected by evil. We speak sinful words, do sinful deeds, have impure thoughts. Our very bodies suffer from the ravages of sin.</p>
        <p>Perhaps <span class="italic">radical corruption</span> is a better term to describe our fallen condition than “total depravity.” I am using the word <span class="italic">radical</span> not so much to mean “extreme,” but to lean more heavily on its original meaning. <span class="italic">Radical</span> comes from the Latin word for “root” or “core.” Our problem with sin is that it is rooted in the core of our being. It permeates our hearts. It is because sin is at our core and not merely at the exterior of our lives that the Bible says:</p>
        <p>None is righteous, no, not one; no one understands; no one seeks for God. All have turned aside; together they have become worthless; no one does good, not even one. (<a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Rom.3.10-Rom.3.12"}'>Romans 3:10–12</a>)</p>
        <p>It is because of this condition that the verdict of Scripture is heard: we are “dead in . . . trespasses and sins” (<a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Eph.2.1"}'>Ephesians 2:1</a>); we are “sold under sin” (<a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Rom.7.14"}'>Romans 7:14</a>); we are “captive to the law of sin” (<a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Rom.7.23"}'>Romans 7:23</a>) and are “by nature children of wrath” (<a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Eph.2.3"}'>Ephesians 2:3</a>). Only by the quickening power of the Holy Spirit may we be brought out of this state of spiritual death. It is God who makes us alive as we become His craftsmanship (<a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Eph.2.1-Eph.2.10"}'>Ephesians 2:1–10</a>).</p>

        <p epub:type="bridgehead">THE SELF-EXISTENCE OF GOD</p>
        <p class="noind">When the Bible declares that God is the Creator of the universe it indicates that God Himself is not created. There is a crucial distinction between the Creator and the creation. The creation bears the stamp of the Creator and witnesses to His glory. But the creation is never to be worshiped. It is not Supreme.</p>
        <p>It is impossible for something to create itself. The concept of self-creation is a contradiction in terms, a nonsense statement. I ask the reader to pause and reflect a bit. Nothing can be self-created. Not even God can make Himself. For God to create Himself He would have to be before He is. Even God can’t do that.</p>
        <p>Every <span class="italic">effect</span> must have a <span class="italic">cause.</span> That is true by definition. But God is not an effect. He has no beginning and therefore no antecedent cause. He is eternal. He always was or is. He has, within Himself, the power of being. He requires no assistance from outside sources to continue to exist. This is what is meant by the idea of <span class="italic">self-existent.</span> Granted, it is a lofty and awesome concept. We know of nothing else quite like it. Everything we perceive in our frame of reference is dependent and creaturely. We can’t fully comprehend anything as self-existent.</p>
        <p>But just because it is impossible (by definition) that a creature be self-existent does not mean it is impossible for the Creator to be self-existent. God, like us, cannot be self-created. But God, unlike us, can be self-existent. Indeed, this is the very essence of the difference between the Creator and creation. This is what makes Him the Supreme Being and the <span class="italic">source</span> of all other beings.</p>
        <p>The concept of self-existence violates no law of reason, logic, or science. It is a rationally valid notion. By contrast, the concept of self-creation violates the most basic law of reason, logic, and science—the law of noncontradiction. Self-existence is rational; self-creation is irrational.</p>
        <p>The notion of something being self-existent is not only rationally <span class="italic">possible,</span> it is rationally <span class="italic">necessary.</span> Again, reason demands that if anything is, then something must have, within itself, the power of being. Otherwise there would be nothing. Unless something existed in itself, nothing could possibly exist at all.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the oldest and deepest question of all is, why is there something rather than nothing? A necessary answer to at least part of the question is because God exists. God exists in Himself eternally. He is the source and fountainhead of all being. He alone has, within Himself, the power of being. Paul declares our dependence upon the power of God’s being for our own existence when he says: “In Him we live and move and have our being” (<a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Acts.17.28"}'>Acts 17:28</a>).</p>

Even before Christ’s coming, a prophetic-messianic interpretation of the psalm was well known among Jewish interpreters. Nevertheless, like all other royal psalms, <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.110.1-Ps.110.7"}'>Ps. 110</a> does address the time in which it was first composed. It is likely that it was sung at the time of the coronation of the king. The composition seems to have been written after David defeated Jebus (Jerusalem) and celebrates his victory and enthronement in that city, explaining why he also inherits the royal priesthood of Melchizedek. Focusing on two divine oracles, the first (<a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.110.1"}'>v. 1</a>) shows the close, but subordinate, relationship that the human king bears to the divine King. The NT writers cite this oracle to demonstrate Jesus’ post-resurrection glory and to point to the struggle between God and the spiritual powers of evil (<a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Acts.2.34-Acts.2.35"}'>Acts 2:34, 35</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"1Cor.15.25"}'>1 Cor. 15:25</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Eph.1.20"}'>Eph. 1:20</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Col.3.1"}'>Col. 3:1</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Heb.1.13"}'>Heb. 1:13</a>; <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"1Pet.3.22"}'>1 Pet. 3:22</a>).

The psalm is an acrostic of twenty-two stanzas, one for each letter of the Hebrew alphabet. The eight poetic lines of each stanza begin with the same Hebrew letter.</p>
      <p>The number eight may be connected with eight Hebrew words that appear throughout the psalm concerning its main theme. The words are translated variously as “law,” “testimonies,” “precepts,” “statutes,” “commandments,” “rules,” and “word.” In five stanzas all eight Hebrew words occur, and every stanza has at least six of the eight.</p>
      <p><a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.119.97"}'>Verse 97</a> is perhaps the theological heart of the psalm, as it expresses the psalmist’s love for God’s law. The psalmist also has a deep desire to live in keeping with this law. Yet the psalmist also recognizes that he has strayed from time to time from the standard set forth in the law. While the emphasis of the psalm is on love for and obedience to the law of God, this is balanced to some degree by an awareness of the need for forgiveness.</p>
      <p>The law is a faithful expression of God’s character. God sent His Son to keep the law for us. The law no longer condemns us, setting us free to accept it as our own guide for pleasing the One who died in our place.</p>

The second stanza (<a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Ps.127.3-Ps.127.5"}'>vv. 3–5</a>) focuses on another meaning of building, that of raising children. Children are a gift from God.</p>
      <p>A father could be supported during his old age by strong, young sons. Children were a fulfillment of the promise to Abraham that the chosen people would become a great and numerous nation (<a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Gen.12.1-Gen.12.3"}'>Gen. 12:1–3</a>).

        <p epub:type="bridgehead">THE GOODNESS OF GOD</p>
        <p class="noind">James declares: “Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights with whom there is no variation or shadow due to change” (<a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Jas.1.17"}'>James 1:17</a>).</p>
        <p>God never changes. With Him there is “no shadow of turning.” This suggests not only that God is immaterial and therefore incapable of casting a shadow, but also that there is no “shadow side,” in a figurative or moral sense, to God. Shadows suggest darkness, and in spiritual terms darkness suggests evil. Since there is no evil in God, there is no hint of darkness in Him either. He is the Father of lights.</p>
        <p>When James adds that there is no “shadow due to change” with God, it is not enough to understand this merely in terms of God’s unchanging or immutable being. This reference is also to God’s character. Not only is God altogether good, He is consistently good. God doesn’t know how to be anything but good.</p>
        <p>So closely linked is goodness to God that even pagan philosophers such as Plato equated ultimate goodness, the highest good, with God Himself. God’s goodness refers both to His character and His behavior. His actions proceed from and flow out of His being. He acts according to what He is. Just as a corrupt tree cannot bear incorrupt fruit, neither can an incorrupt God produce corrupt fruit.</p>
        <p>The law of God reflects His goodness. God is said to be good not because He obeys some cosmic law outside of Himself that judges Him or because God so defines goodness that He can act in a lawless manner and by the sheer power of His authority declare His actions good. God’s goodness is neither arbitrary nor capricious. God does obey a law, but the law He obeys is the law of His own character. He always acts according to His own character, which is eternally, immutably, and intrinsically good. James teaches that every good and perfect gift comes from God. He is not only the ultimate standard of goodness; He is the Source of all goodness.</p>
        <p>One of the most popular New Testament verses is <a data-cross-ref='{"scripture":"Rom.8.28"}'>Romans 8:28</a>: “And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose.” This text on divine providence is as difficult to comprehend as it is popular. If God is able to make everything that happens to us work together for our good, then ultimately everything that happens to us is good. We must be careful to stress here the word <span class="italic">ultimately.</span> On the earthly plane things that happen to us may indeed be evil. (We must be careful not to call good, evil or evil, good.) We encounter affliction, misery, injustice, and a host of other evils. Yet God in His goodness transcends all of these things and works them to our good. For the Christian, <span class="italic">ultimately,</span> there are no tragedies. Ultimately, the providence of God works all these proximate evils for our final benefit.</p>
        <p>Martin Luther understood this aspect of God’s good providence when he said, “If God told me to eat the dung from off the streets, not only would I eat it, but I would know it was good for me.”</p>

This poem is the first of six hymns that close the Psalter like a display of fireworks. The psalm is an acrostic, each parallel line beginning with a consecutive letter of the alphabet. One letter (<span class="italic">nun</span>) is missing, here, possibly because a copyist inadvertently overlooked it. (Its omission does not affect the meaning of the psalm or any biblical doctrine.) Many of the key verbs for “praise” are found in this psalm. Repetition of royal language also fills the psalm.
